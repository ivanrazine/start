# Start
Every project needs a Start. This is mine ^_^

In the `index.html` you will find the following calls:

* Open Graph
* Bootstrap CSS
* Material Icons
* Google Analytics

## Installation

### Node.js

Download Node https://nodejs.org

### Gulp

Install Gulp `npm install --global gulp-cli`

## How to use

Run `npm install` in the command line, wait for the node modules to install in the `node_modules` folder and then feel free to edit the files in the `src` folder to your liking.

Run `gulp watch` or `gulp w` to activate the dev mode, which observes the CSS and JS files for changes and compiles on each save with browser sync and error notifications.

Run `gulp compile` or `gulp c` to compile and minify the CSS and JS files for prod.

Enjoy!
